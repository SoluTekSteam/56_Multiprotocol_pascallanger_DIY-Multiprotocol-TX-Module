This directory contains the DSM Forward programming settings
for each model. Like Wing Type, Tail Type, and Channels assignments.

The name is the first 5 characters of the model and a hash number to make them unique.

If you want to REDO a model from scratch, just delete the file or change the Aircraft type to reset.

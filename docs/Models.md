#Model Setup
This is the page to document model or receiver specific setup instructions.
The complete list of models the protocols they use are documented [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBHzT3VWF6ShAhOqRB5y0Bcc7aXFuRFFlQkHn1RIM84/edit#gid=0)

The Deviation project (on which this project was based) have a useful list of models [here](http://www.deviationtx.com/wiki/supported_models).
